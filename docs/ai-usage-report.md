How to write documentation that explain my code properly 
Improve my skills in how to improve the AI outcomes 


How you modified AI suggestions responsibly:
After giving a proper propmt that explain the task clearly I had to write some code that gives a base for the model in order to improve  this base code only without giving an out of scope code
